## Extend
Every config file that is being sourced from `~/.zsh-conf/` is also being sourced from `~/.my-zsh-conf/`.
In addition `~/.my_zshrc` is loaded as well.

For example in order to add aliases you should create `~/.my-zsh-conf/aliases.zsh` and add them there. You can add them in `~/.my_zshrc` as well.

You can extend `starship.toml` as well.
